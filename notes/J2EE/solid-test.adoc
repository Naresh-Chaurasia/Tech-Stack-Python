== SOLID Q1

Which principle states that a class should have only one reason to change?

[%collapsible]
====
The *Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)*. It ensures that a class is focused on one task or responsibility.

== SOLID Q2

Which principle is violated in the below code?

[source, java]
----
public class Report {
    public void generateReport() {
        // logic to generate report
    }

    public void saveToFile() {
        // logic to save to file
    }

    public void sendEmail() {
        // logic to send email
    }
}

====
*Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)* is violated. This class is doing 3 different jobs: generating, saving, and emailing.

== SOLID Q3

Which principle encourages extending a class's behavior without modifying it?

.Click Here For Answer
[%collapsible]
====
The *Open/Closed Principle (OCP)* — classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
====

== SOLID Q4

What principle does the following code follow?

[source, java]
----
public interface Shape {
    double area();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * 5 * 5;
    }
}

====
This follows the *Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)*. `Circle` can be used wherever `Shape` is expected.
====

== SOLID Q5

Which principle is violated in this example?

[source, java]
----
public interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}
----

====
*Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)* is violated. Not all workers may need both methods (e.g., robots don't eat).
====

== SOLID Q6

How does the following code violate the Dependency Inversion Principle?

[source, java]
----
public class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() { System.out.println("Light On"); }
}

public class Switch {
    private LightBulb bulb = new LightBulb();
    public void operate() { bulb.turnOn(); }
}
----

====
The `Switch` is tightly coupled to `LightBulb`. DIP is violated — high-level modules should depend on abstractions.
====

== SOLID Q7

Which principle is being applied here?

[source, java]
----
public interface Printer {
    void print(String text);
}

public class ConsolePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print(String text) {
        System.out.println(text);
    }
}
----

====
This follows the *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)* by depending on an abstraction (`Printer`) instead of a concrete class.
====

== SOLID Q8

How can you fix this SRP violation?

[source, java]
----
public class Invoice {
    public void calculateTotal() {}
    public void printInvoice() {}
}
----

====
Split into two classes: one for calculation, one for printing. SRP suggests each class should have one responsibility.
====

== SOLID Q9

What is the benefit of Interface Segregation Principle in real-world applications?

.Click Here For Answer
[%collapsible]
====
It avoids forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods, leading to cleaner and more focused interfaces.
====

== SOLID Q10

What change would make the below code follow Open/Closed Principle?

[source, java]
----
public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateCircleArea() { return Math.PI * 5 * 5; }
    public double calculateRectangleArea() { return 10 * 5; }
}
----

====
Introduce a `Shape` interface with an `area()` method. Then create separate `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes. This way, you can add new shapes without modifying `AreaCalculator`.

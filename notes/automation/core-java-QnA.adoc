== Core Java Programming Exercise

* Write a program to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.  

* *Logic:* Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100. Check if a number is even using the modulus operator (`number % 2 == 0`). Add all such numbers.  

* *Example:* The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30.  

---

* Write a program to check if a given number is prime or not.  

* *Logic:* A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Check divisibility using a loop from 2 to `number/2`.  

* *Example:* 5 is a prime number because it is divisible only by 1 and 5.  

---

* Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.  

* *Logic:* Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Use a loop to generate the series.  

* *Example:* For `n = 5`, the series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.  

---

* Write a program to reverse a given number.  

* *Logic:* Extract digits of the number using the modulus operator and reconstruct the number in reverse order.  

* *Example:* For the input `1234`, the output is `4321`.  

---

* Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.  

* *Logic:* Factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to the number itself. Use a loop or recursion.  

* *Example:* Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.  

---

* Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome.  

* *Logic:* A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. Compare the string with its reverse.  

* *Example:* "radar" is a palindrome, but "java" is not.  

---

* Write a program to find the second largest number in an array.  

* *Logic:* Traverse the array to find the largest and second largest numbers by comparing elements.  

* *Example:* For the array [3, 1, 4, 2], the second largest number is 3.  

---

* Write a program to sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.  

* *Logic:* Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until the array is sorted.  

* *Example:* For [4, 2, 3, 1], after sorting, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].  

---

* Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a given number.  

* *Logic:* Extract digits of the number using modulus and division operators. Add the digits.  

* *Example:* For `123`, the sum of digits is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  

---

* Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number.  

* *Logic:* Use a loop to multiply the number by 1 to 10 and print the results.  

* *Example:* For `n = 3`, the table is:  
  ```
  3 × 1 = 3  
  3 × 2 = 6  
  ...  
  3 × 10 = 30  
  ```  

---

* Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.  

* *Logic:* Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequency. Sort both strings and compare them.  

* *Example:* "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.  

---

* Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.  

* *Logic:* Traverse the string, check each character, and count vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and consonants.  

* *Example:* For "hello", vowels = 2, consonants = 3.  

---

* Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.  

* *Logic:* Use the Euclidean algorithm where GCD of two numbers is calculated recursively.  

* *Example:* GCD of 12 and 15 is 3.  

---

14. Write a program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.  

* *Logic:* A number is an Armstrong number if the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself.  

* *Example:* 153 is an Armstrong number because 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153.  

---

* Write a program to generate all prime numbers between 1 and 100.  

* *Logic:* Use nested loops to check divisibility for each number from 2 to 100. Print numbers that are prime.  

---

* Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.  

* *Logic:* Use arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction or XOR to swap the numbers.  

* *Example:* If a = 3, b = 5, after swapping: a = 5, b = 3.  

---

* Write a program to print a pattern, such as:  
  ```
  *
  **
  ***
  ****
  ```  

* *Logic:* Use nested loops where the outer loop runs for the number of rows and the inner loop prints stars for each row.  

---

* Write a program to check if a number is a perfect number.  

* *Logic:* A number is perfect if the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) equals the number.  

* *Example:* 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  

---

* Write a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in an array.  

* *Logic:* Traverse the array, keeping track of the largest and smallest values.  

* *Example:* For [3, 1, 4, 2], the largest is 4, and the smallest is 1.  

---

* Write a program to implement a basic calculator with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

* *Logic:* Use a switch-case statement to perform operations based on user input.  

* *Example:* For inputs `5, 3, +`, the result is `8`.

== Java OOP Programming Assignments

==== Assignment 1: Basic Class and Object
Create a class called `Car` with the following attributes:
- `make` (String)
- `model` (String)
- `year` (int)

Create a constructor to initialize these attributes. Write a method called `displayInfo()` that prints the details of the car.

*Sample Output:*
```
Make: Toyota
Model: Corolla
Year: 2020
```

==== Assignment 2: Constructor Overloading
Create a class called `Person` with two constructors:
- One constructor should accept the person's name and age.
- The other constructor should accept only the person's name and set the age to 25 by default.

Write a method called `displayPersonInfo()` that prints the person's details.

*Sample Output:*
```
Name: John
Age: 30
```

==== Assignment 3: Inheritance and Method Overriding
Create a base class `Animal` with a method `sound()` that prints "Animal makes a sound". Create a derived class `Dog` that overrides the `sound()` method to print "Bark".

Write a main method to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.

*Sample Output:*
```
Animal makes a sound
Bark
```

==== Assignment 4: Encapsulation
Create a class called `BankAccount` with private attributes:
- `accountNumber` (String)
- `balance` (double)

Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes. Include a method `deposit(double amount)` to add money to the balance and a method `withdraw(double amount)` to subtract from the balance.

*Sample Output:*
```
Account Number: 12345
Balance: $1000.0
```

==== Assignment 5: Polymorphism with Method Overloading
Create a class called `Calculator` with the following methods:
- `add(int a, int b)`
- `add(double a, double b)`
- `add(int a, int b, int c)`

Write a main method to test all the overloaded methods of the `Calculator` class.

*Sample Output:*
```
Sum of integers: 5
Sum of doubles: 7.5
Sum of three integers: 9
```

==== Assignment 6: Static Variables and Methods
Create a class called `Counter` with a static variable `count` and a static method `incrementCount()` to increment the count by 1. Write a main method to demonstrate the use of static variables and methods.

*Sample Output:*
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
```

==== Assignment 7: Interface Implementation
Create an interface called `Shape` with two methods:
- `double calculateArea()`
- `double calculatePerimeter()`

Create two classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that implement the `Shape` interface. Each class should provide its own implementation of the methods.

*Sample Output:*
```
Circle area: 78.5
Rectangle area: 20
```

==== Assignment 8: Abstraction with Abstract Classes
Create an abstract class called `Vehicle` with an abstract method `move()`. Create two classes, `Car` and `Bicycle`, that extend the `Vehicle` class and implement the `move()` method.

*Sample Output:*
```
The car moves fast.
The bicycle moves slowly.
```

==== Assignment 9: Aggregation
Create a class `Library` with an attribute `Book[] books` (an array of books). Create a class `Book` with attributes `title` (String) and `author` (String). Demonstrate the concept of aggregation by creating a `Library` object that contains multiple `Book` objects.

*Sample Output:*
```
Library contains:
1. Title: The Great Gatsby, Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
2. Title: Moby Dick, Author: Herman Melville
```

==== Assignment 10: Exception Handling with Custom Exceptions
Create a custom exception called `InvalidAgeException` that is thrown when the age of a person is less than 0. Create a class `Person` with an age attribute, and use exception handling to catch invalid ages.

*Sample Output:*
```
InvalidAgeException: Age cannot be negative!
```


==== Assignment 11: Using `this` Keyword
Create a class called `Student` with the following attributes:
- `name` (String)
- `age` (int)

In the constructor, use the `this` keyword to distinguish between the instance variables and the constructor parameters. Create a method called `displayInfo()` that displays the student's details.

*Sample Output:*

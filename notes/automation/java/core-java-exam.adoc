== Java Coding Assignment

== Instructions

- Solve all the questions.
- Use proper naming conventions and comments in your code.

== Creating Object and Calling Methods with Arguments

Create a Java class named `Student` with the following requirements:

- Define two instance variables: `name` (String) and `age` (int).
- Add a method `setDetails(String name, int age)` to set the student's name and age.
- Add a `display()` method to print the student's details.
- In the `main()` method, create an object of the `Student` class and call the methods using the object with appropriate arguments.

== Using Static Methods and Variables

Create a class called `Counter` that counts the number of objects created:

- Use a static variable `count` to keep track of the object count.
- In the constructor, increase the `count` variable by 1 each time an object is created.
- Add a static method `displayCount()` to display the total number of objects.
- In the `main()` method, create multiple objects and display the total count using the static method.

== Method Chaining

Create a `Person` class with the following:

- Two instance variables: `name` (String) and `age` (int).
- Add setter methods `setName()` and `setAge()` that return the current object to enable method chaining.
- Add a `display()` method to print the details.
- In the `main()` method, use method chaining to set the name and age, then call the `display()` method.

== Collections (List, Set, and Map)

Write a Java program to demonstrate the usage of `List`, `Set`, and `Map`:

- Create a `List` to store names with duplicates.
- Convert the `List` to a `Set` to remove duplicates.
- Create a `Map` that associates ID (Integer) with names (String).
- Print all the collections.

== Arrays in Java

Write a program that performs the following tasks:

- Create an integer array of size 5 and initialize it with random values.
- Find and print the sum of all the elements.
- Find and print the largest value in the array.

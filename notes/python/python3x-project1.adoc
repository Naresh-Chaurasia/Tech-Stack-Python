= Mini Project: Student Record Management

== Project Overview

You need to write a Python program that manages student records.
Each student will have:

* name (string)
* roll number (integer)
* grades for subjects (list of integers)

Your program will:

* store all students in a list
* allow operations like:
** add a student
** list all students
** calculate the average grade of a student
** show the top-performing student
** show the set of all subjects taken (using a set)
** store students in a dictionary with roll number as the key
* implement the logic using loops and functions
* demonstrate data types like tuple, list, set, and dictionary

== Requirements

=== 1. Data Structure Design

* Use a dictionary where the **key** is the roll number, and the **value** is a tuple: (student_name, grades_list).
* Example:
[source, python]
----
students = {
    101: ("Alice", [90, 85, 88]),
    102: ("Bob", [70, 75, 80])
}
----

=== 2. Functions to Implement

* `add_student()`: Adds a new student.
* `list_students(students)`: Prints all students with their grades.
* `average_grade(students, roll_no)`: Calculates the average grade for a specific student.
* `top_student(students)`: Finds the student with the highest average grade.

=== 3. Suggested Flow

* Show a menu to the user:
** 1. Add Student
** 2. List all students
** 3. Show a student's average grade
** 4. Show top-performing student
** 5. Exit

* Use loops (`while` or `for`), data structures (`list`, `set`, `tuple`, `dictionary`), and types (`int`, `str`, `float`).



== Learning Objectives

* Applying basic Python data types (`int`, `str`, `float`)
* Using collections (`list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dictionary`)
* Implementing loops and conditionals (`for`, `while`, `if`)
* Writing modular code with functions

== Assignment: Operators and Logic

1. Create a program that has two numbers (e.g., 10 and 5) and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

2. Define a variable for age (e.g., age = 25) and print whether the person is a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen using if-else statements.

3. Create a variable with a number (e.g., number = 7) and print whether it is even or odd.

4. Define a temperature in Celsius (e.g., celsius = 30) and convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C \* 9/5) + 32.

5. Create three number variables (e.g., a = 4, b = 9, c = 2) and print the largest number among them.

6. Define a string variable (e.g., text = "Python") and print whether the length of the string is greater than 5 or not.

7. Define a number (e.g., num = 15) and check if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.

8. Define two numbers (e.g., x = 10, y = 20). Swap their values using a third variable and then swap them again without using a third variable.

9. Create a simple calculator using three variables: num1 = 12, num2 = 4, and operator = '\*'. Print the result based on the operator.

10. Define price = 25 and quantity = 5. Calculate the total cost. If the total is more than 100, apply a 10% discount and print the final amount.

== Assignment: List

*Assignment 1: Fruit Basket*

*Objective:* Practice `append()`, `insert()`, and `remove()` methods.

*Instructions:*

1. Create a list called `basket` with 3 fruits.
2. Add a new fruit to the end of the list.
3. Insert a fruit at the second position.
4. Remove one fruit by name.
5. Print the updated list.

*Assignment 2: Favorite Numbers*

*Objective:* Use indexing, length, and loops.

*Instructions:*

1. Create a list `numbers` with 5 of your favorite numbers.
2. Print the first and last number using indexing.
3. Print the total number of items using `len()`.
4. Use a `for` loop to print each number.

*Assignment 3: List Cleanup and Sorting*

*Objective:* Use `pop()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, and `clear()`.

*Instructions:*

1. Create a list `cities` with 6 city names.
2. Remove the last city using `pop()`.
3. Sort the list alphabetically.
4. Reverse the order of the list.
5. Clear the entire list.
6. Print the list after each step to see the changes.

== Assignment: Set

*1: Create a Set*

Create a set of 5 fruits. Print the set.

*2: Add Items to Set*

Start with a set of 3 colors. Add 2 more colors using the `add()` method. Print the final set.

*3: Remove Item from Set*

Create a set of cities. Remove one city using the `remove()` method. Then try removing a city using `discard()` that does not exist.

*4: Check Membership*

Create a set of programming languages. Check if `"Python"` is in the set and print the result.

*5: Length of Set*

Create a set of 7 unique numbers. Print the total number of elements using `len()`.

*6: Loop Through Set*

Create a set of 4 animals. Use a loop to print each animal on a new line.

*7: Set Union*

Create two sets:
- `set1 = {"apple", "banana"}`
- `set2 = {"banana", "cherry"}`
Find and print the union of both sets.

*8: Set Intersection*

Using the same `set1` and `set2`, print the common items using `intersection()`.
